      Just Animate makes animating websites easier by making creating and reusing animations very simple. 
    This site is still in the early stages, so please standby for see the README on 
    <a href="https://github.com/just-animate/just-animate">GitHub</a> for now.

    If you would like to contribute, please send me a message.  I am not just looking for coders: help with the animation timings, better demos, and more complete documentation is just as important at this moment.
