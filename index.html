<h2>About Just Animate</h2>

  Just Animate makes it easy to animate websites.  It comes with over 70 animations for entrances, exits, and of course fun.  The main goal of Just Animate is
  to provide a simple way to get started with animations built upon the Web Animations API and to grow from there to building animation sequences and more complex timelines.
